# WorkScheduler

This site randomly generates a password.  It allows the user to choose any number of characters between 8 and 128.  The user can also choose if they would like the password to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, special charaters or any combination of them. Finally a randomly generated password will be shown for the user.

## Java Script used

1. Listener for the Generate button
2. A function that verify's the number is between 2 values and a number.
3. If statements to combine multiple arrays into a new array using array.push().
4. Using the lenght of the array and number of charaters chosen by the user make passes through a random number generator and use the number generated on each pass to return that array id.
